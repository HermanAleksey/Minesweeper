         1.If you open a cell with a mine, you lose; \n
         2. The number in the cell shows how many mines are hidden in the immediately adjacent cells; \n
         3.If there is nothing in an open cell, this is equivalent to zero minutes around this cell; \n \n

        when you touch a cell on the field - this cell is marked with a flag. \n
        If the cell has already been marked with a flag before, the flag is removed. \n \n

        If the Shovel icon is selected: \n
        when you touch a cell on the field, it opens it. \n

        you need to slide the pressed finger along the field horizontally or vertically, depending on
        from the desired direction. \n \n

        ----------- \n
